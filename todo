Documentation
	Docstrings are quite easy.
	Examples (jldoctest/Documenter.jl) would be nice
Strip bad comments - progress
Check APIs
explicitly export things
	export affects `using` and not much else

Motifs.jl

New features:
	Accept coloredG
	   - answers[k] needs to hash on canong, partition and label
	   - Nauty doesn't know about all the colours in G.
	      - Can add a key (disconnected node of each colour)

Tidying:
	Strip bad comments
	s/nauty/Nauty
	Hide kavosh as implementation detail?

Documentation:

	normalise:

	distribution of motifs

	Getmotifs:

	Enumerate all connected subgraphs of size k from G efficiently
	Return frequency of each isomorphism class present

	Optionally "normalise"
	   - lots of different methods incl. z score

Extension stuff
   - Enumerate all subgraphs but don't filter by isomorphic class (for metagraphs)
   - Generator
